<h1>Ain't that Cool</h1>
<h2>By Edgardo-38</h2>
  
<p>Oh! That's Cool not influencing<br>
Just existing in today's ever changing world<br>
I wanted to provide you with a place<br>
To about some Feedback.<br><p>

<p>That's Cool!<br>
Where we highlight the amazing people<br>
Finally a community<br>
That's founded and grounded<br>
In simplicity and quality<br>
Oh! what great individuals.<br><p>

<p>But gone are the days<br>
Of someone telling you<br>
About something<br>
That you really don't care about.<br><p>

<p>Oh that's cool<br>
I found a super response<br>
getting peeved out<br>
By a such an unfortunate problem<br>
So in that response.<br><p>

<p>I say something<br>
As mundane to some people<br>
As if they think I really meant it<br>
I respond with “I guess” or “not really”<br>
That whatever they're doing<br>
Is actually cool and important.<br><p>

<p>Don't see anyone else<br>
Do you feel down when someone says<br>
“Oh hey, that's cool?”<br>
And replies with<br>
“Oh wow isn’t that nice.”<br><p>

<p>Have you ever seen something<br>
That's dedicated to you<br>
What to say<br>
So you say “oh good.”<br><p>

<p>How do you respond to that<br>
Like "that's cool" or "oh wow”<br>
The weird, odd, or otherwise interesting things<br>
The approval, appreciation, or agreement.<br><p>

<p>Something they’ve said or done<br>
They don’t have anything else to say<br>
Doesn’t wanna offend you<br>
Truly thinks they’re that cool<br>
So I throw Decor that's In stock and funny.<br>
</p>
